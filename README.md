## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The project is organized into two parts:

- **Backend**: Implemented as a [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script), deployed as a web app.
- **Frontend**: A static site that can be deployed to any platform (e.g., GitHub Pages). It uses a `env.js` file for runtime configuration.

To run both components correctly, you must define the following environment variables.
